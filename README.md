# Three.js Quick Start with Next.js

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of Three.js with Next.js, creating an interactive 3D model viewer that runs directly in the browser. This application serves as a starting point for developers looking to incorporate 3D graphics into their web applications using modern web technologies.

## Project Description

This Three.js Quick Start project is a web-based 3D model viewer built with Next.js and Three.js. It allows users to view and interact with 3D models in real-time, showcasing the power of web-based 3D graphics and the flexibility of modern web development frameworks.

Key features of this project include:

- Loading and displaying GLTF 3D models
- Switching between multiple 3D models
- Adjusting model rotation speed in real-time
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Built with modern web technologies (Next.js, Three.js, shadcn UI)

This project serves as an excellent starting point for developers interested in:
- Learning how to integrate Three.js with Next.js
- Exploring 3D graphics capabilities in web browsers
- Understanding how to create interactive 3D experiences on the web
